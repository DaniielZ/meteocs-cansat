# Setting up the groundstation UI
- Install Serial Studio (1.17) [here](https://serial-studio.github.io/)
- Choose the correct serial data formating/project file (the .JSON file that is located in this folder)
- Connect to com port
- If the device only starts working if a serial port is detected then you might need to connect to the com port from a different serial monitor insted and then connect from serial studio
